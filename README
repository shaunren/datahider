datahider.py
By Shaun Ren

1. Introduction
datahider.py is a script used to encode/decode data into/from an image by 
manipulating the LSB of every band(R,G,B) of the pixels in the image. This
yields an image that has no noticable difference compared to the original (
both size and visual) yet effectively storing data into the image.

2. Usage
Encoding data: ./datahider.py <original image> <output image> <data>
Decoding data: ./datahider.py -d <image with data>

3. Limitations
datahider.py can only store a single file. However, this can be solved by
archiving all the files into a single tarball and possibly compressing it.
This script also does not provide any encryption algorithms, therefore
encrypting the file before encoding is recommended. 

The method used by this script, storing one bit of information on every band,
yields 1 byte of data per three pixels. The script also adds a header of length
28~282 bytes depending on the length of the file name. Therefore, you can store
at least # of pixels / 3 - 282 bytes of data and at most # of pixels / 3 - 28.

    e.g. a photo shot by a 3.1 MP camera (2048 * 1536) can store about
         (2048 * 1536) / 3 - 282 = 1048294 bytes of data, or around 1MB.
